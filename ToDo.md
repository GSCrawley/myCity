## Styling changes to make before submitting to the Computer Science Community Showcase:

- Change the background color on all pages, something subtle, a very light pastel just to make it a bit more dynamic

- if possible, use bootstrap to make all the pages responsive (so it fits any size screen)

- put borders around images and text

- on the RESOURCES page, make the fonts uniform, and fix the styling to make it a little more interesting

- on the BENEFTIS and HEALTH RESOURCES pages, put the sections on cards and use flexbox a nd a grid to separate them
